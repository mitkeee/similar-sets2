Subject: Short update — Similar-Sets repo changes and next steps

Hi all,

I reviewed both the original and the updated repository. Quick summary:

- What changed: The update adds a cache-friendly block-based skiplist (`cskiplist`) and an adapter (`connector_csl.c`) that plugs the new structure into the existing connector API. Test code and documentation for the skiplist were added as well.
- Why this helps: Better memory locality, backward/forward iteration support (including reverse scans), and runtime stats for monitoring. The adapter preserves compatibility with existing code paths.

What I implemented for convenience:

- `con_export_keys(connector*, int* out_buf, int max)` — a small helper that dumps connector keys into an integer buffer for quick inspection or debugging.

Suggested next steps (small, actionable):

- Add a Makefile target to build and run the enhanced skiplist tests.
- Add a tiny example program that uses `con_export_keys` to write keys to CSV for ad-hoc checks.
- Consider a controlled rebuild strategy: e.g., call `csl_rebuild_skips()` periodically or after a threshold of splits (use runtime stats to decide).

If you’d like, I can:

- Add the example program and a Makefile target now.
- Build and run the tests, and share a short performance/consistency report.
- Prepare a 5–10 minute demo showing the skiplist advantages and the `con_export_keys` usage.

Best,
Milos
