Subject: Similar-Sets Project Update - Old vs New Version Comparison

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

The new version adds a modern block-based skiplist data structure as an alternative to the original array-based connector.

NEW FILES ADDED:
• cskiplist.h / cskiplist.c - Cache-friendly skiplist implementation
• connector_csl.c - Adapter connecting the new skiplist to existing API
• test-cskiplist.c / test-cskiplist-enhanced.c - Test suites
• SKIPLIST_IMPROVEMENTS.md - Documentation

KEY IMPROVEMENTS:
• Better memory efficiency with block-based storage
• Backward iteration support via reverse pointers
• Automatic block splitting and statistics tracking
• Safe operations even without full rebuilds
• Comprehensive test coverage

ORIGINAL FILES:
• Remain unchanged (set.c, set2.c, config.c, etc.)
• Full backward compatibility maintained

FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS

Possible improvements for next iterations:

• Incremental rebuild - Update skip pointers partially instead of full rebuild
• Key compression - Use delta encoding within blocks to reduce memory
• Parallel operations - Add thread-safe locking for concurrent access
• Persistence - Save/load skiplist to disk
• Performance tuning - Optimize block size and skip patterns
• Memory pooling - Reduce allocation overhead for large datasets
